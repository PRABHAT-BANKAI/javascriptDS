## 1. Sum of All Elements in a 2D Array
Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in a 2D array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`  
Output:  
`Sum = 45`

## 2. Find Maximum Element in a 2D Array
Write a program to find the maximum value in a 2D array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`arr = [[3, 8, 1], [7, 2, 9], [4, 6, 5]]`  
Output:  
`Maximum = 9`

---

## 3. Row-wise Sum
Write a program to calculate the sum of elements row by row in a 2D array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`  
Output:  
`Row 1 Sum = 6, Row 2 Sum = 15, Row 3 Sum = 24`

---

## 4. Transpose of a Matrix
Write a program to compute the transpose of a 2D array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`arr = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`  
Output:  
`Transpose = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]`

---

## 5. Count Odd and Even Numbers in a 2D Array
Write a program to count the total number of odd and even numbers in a 2D array.

**Example:**  
Input:  
`arr = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`  
Output:  
`Odd Count = 3, Even Count = 3`
